"""Alert state machine.

Alerts are identified by (rule id, complete label set); label ordering does
not change identity.  A series whose value is strictly greater than the rule
threshold enters ``pending``; it only becomes ``firing`` after the condition
has held continuously for the rule's duration on a monotonic clock (a zero
duration fires immediately).  Recovery, series disappearance and scrape
failures clear ``pending`` silently and resolve a ``firing`` alert exactly
once with a reason.  Re-exceeding the threshold restarts the timer from
scratch: pending time never accumulates across failed or healthy rounds.
